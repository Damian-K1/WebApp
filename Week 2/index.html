    <h3>Plot Summary:</h3>
    <p>
        "Frankenstein," directed by Guillermo del Toro based on the novel written by Mary Shelley, 
        tells the story of Victor Frankenstein, a young scientist who creates a grotesque but 
        sentient creature in an unorthodox scientific experiment. The movie explores themes of 
        ambition, responsibility, and the consequences of playing God. As the creature seeks acceptance 
        and understanding, it faces rejection and isolation, leading to tragic outcomes for both creator 
        and creation.
